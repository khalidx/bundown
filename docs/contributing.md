# Contributing

If you have any bugs, feature requests, etc. please open a [discussion](https://github.com/rysana-ai/bundown/discussions), [issue](https://github.com/rysana-ai/bundown/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/rysana-ai/bundown/pulls) as appropriate.

Before you open a PR, use [`bundown run/format.md`](../run/format.md) to format the code with `biome`. We use an opinionated style guide, aimed at maximizing the intuitive readability of code and minimizing noisy syntax - please follow it.

We also have a [roadmap](roadmap.md) of planned features and bugs we'd like to fix if you'd like to contribute by picking one up.
