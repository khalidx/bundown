# Roadmap

#### Features

- [ ] `bundown --tag <tag> <file.md>` (`-t`) runs only code blocks with the specified tag.
- [ ] `bundown` auto-detects operating system and does not run code blocks tagged as specific to other operating systems.
- [ ] `bundown build <file.md>` builds a Markdown file into a directory of files generated by concatenating code blocks associated with file names, including supported languages as well as file types like `html`, `css`, `json`, `yml`, `.gitignore`, etc.
- [ ] `bundown build bundown.md` is used to build the `bundown` codebase from a single Markdown file.
- [ ] `bundown https://example.com/file.md` runs a Markdown file from a URL.
- [ ] `bundown --safe <file.md>` pretty-prints each code block before running with a Y/N prompt to run it.
- [ ] `bundown` uses source mapping to deliver helpful and traceable error messages when code blocks or individual lines of code fail.
- [ ] `bundown` can run Python code blocks.
- [ ] `bundown` can run C/C++ code blocks.
- [ ] `bundown` can run Rust code blocks.
- [ ] `bundown` can run Zig code blocks.
- [ ] `bundown` shares variables and functions between code blocks, regardless of language.

#### Improvements

- [ ] `bundown` should properly escape the content of Shell code blocks when compiling the executed TypeScript file.
- [ ] `bundown` should check that the user has `bun@^1.0.24` installed and in their `$PATH` and report a helpful error message if not.
